**Your Personal Digital Sanctuary for Thoughts, Links, and Code.**

---

## üåü Introduction

Welcome to **ArcHive** ‚Äì a multi-platform digital capture tool designed to be your personal "second brain." In an age of information overload, ArcHive provides a calm, uncluttered, and intelligent space to effortlessly save, organize, and retrieve all the valuable pieces of information you encounter daily. From fleeting thoughts and insightful articles to crucial code snippets, ArcHive ensures your knowledge is not just stored, but truly _archived_ and always at your fingertips.

## üí° The Philosophy Behind ArcHive

ArcHive is more than just an application; it's a testament to the belief that technology, much like music, can be a profound form of art.

As a Full Stack Engineer who sees the artistry in crafting elegant solutions and harmonious systems, I, embarked on this project with a clear vision: to build a tool that is not only highly functional but also intuitive, aesthetically pleasing, and deeply personal.

Inspired by the need for a private, uncluttered space to capture and manage the diverse streams of information that fuel creativity and learning, ArcHive was born. It's about creating a digital extension of your mind ‚Äì a place where information isn't just dumped, but thoughtfully curated and easily retrieved, much like a well-organized library of your favorite movies or anime.

My goal with ArcHive is to empower creators, thinkers, and anyone passionate about knowledge to focus on their craft without the burden of information overload. It's about making personal knowledge management an effortless and even delightful experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get ArcHive up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) (or use Docker for a quick setup)

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Copy the example environment file and configure it:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Edit `.env` and configure all required values:

   - `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET`: A strong secret key (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` & `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: From Google Cloud Console
   - `OAUTH_REDIRECT_BASE_URL`: Your backend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)
   - `CORS_ORIGINS`: Comma-separated list of allowed frontend origins

   See `.env.example` for detailed descriptions of each variable.

5. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

   The server should start on `http://localhost:3000`.

6. Start the worker:

   ```bash
   bun start:worker
   ```

### Mobile App Setup

1. Navigate to the `mobile` directory:

   ```bash
   cd mobile
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the Expo development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will open a new tab in your browser with the Expo Dev Tools. You can then scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone, or choose to run it on an Android emulator or iOS simulator.
